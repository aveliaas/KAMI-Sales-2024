- The products 'HP3 22KG' and 'AZOMITE 20KG-BM' offer high profit margins, presenting a strong opportunity to boost overall profitability by increasing their sales.
- Incentives such as rewards and discounts can be offered to the top four buyers, as their spending exceeds that of the average customer.
